# Azure AD Duplicate Device Removal Script
This script helps identify and remove duplicate computer objects in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) that are causing issues, particularly when using services like Intune for device management.

Install-Module -Name AzureAD

4. Open a PowerShell session and navigate to the directory where the script is saved.
5. Run the script using the following command:
.\Remove-DuplicateDevices.ps1


6. The script will retrieve Windows OS devices from Azure AD, identify duplicates based on display name, and keep the device with the most recent last login date while removing duplicates.
7. Review the output and confirm the removal of devices before proceeding.
8. After reviewing, the script will prompt you to confirm the removal. Type `Y` or `y` to proceed with the removal. To cancel, type any other key.
9. The script will remove the duplicate devices from Azure AD.
10. Its recommended to monitor the script execution and verify the results in the Azure AD admin center.
